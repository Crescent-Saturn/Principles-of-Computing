#### Plotting
the module for import is :
> simpleplot

the input should be lists of points.

#### Grid
Given a square, we can store the index associated with a square as the tuple (row,col) in Python. Then, we can represent some relevant property of that square as the entry 𝚌𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚜[𝚛𝚘𝚠][𝚌𝚘𝚕] in the 2D list 𝚌𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚜. Note the expression 𝚌𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚜[𝚛𝚘𝚠] returns a 1D list corresponding to a row of the grid.
